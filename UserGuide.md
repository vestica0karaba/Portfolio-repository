# Virtual Machine User Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up, configuring, and using a Virtual Machine (VM) on a system.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:
- A computer with virtualization support enabled in BIOS
- Virtualization software (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V)
- An ISO file of the operating system you wish to install

## Step 1: Installing Virtualization Software
1. Download the virtualization software from the official website.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Restart your computer if required.

## Step 2: Creating a New Virtual Machine
1. Open the virtualization software.
2. Click on `New` to create a new VM.
3. Enter a name for your VM and select the operating system type.
4. Allocate RAM (recommended: at least 2GB for Linux, 4GB for Windows).
5. Create a virtual hard disk and specify the storage size (recommended: 20GB+).

## Step 3: Installing an Operating System
1. Select the newly created VM and click `Start`.
2. Browse and select the ISO file.
3. Follow the installation steps provided by the operating system.
4. Remove the ISO from the virtual CD drive.

## Step 4: Configuring the VM
- Adjust CPU and RAM settings in `Settings > System`.
- Configure network settings for internet access.
- Install Guest Additions (if using VirtualBox) for better performance.

## Step 5: Using the VM
- Start the VM and log in.
- Install necessary software and drivers.
- Save snapshots to revert to previous states if needed.

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Solution |
|--------|---------|
| VM runs slowly | Allocate more RAM and CPU cores |
| No internet connection | Check network adapter settings |
| OS installation fails | Verify the integrity of the ISO file |

## Conclusion
You have successfully set up a virtual machine. You can use it to test and develop software.
